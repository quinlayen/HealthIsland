              treat disease and perform complex surgical procedures in ways
              never before possible. Virtual Reality medical technology has also

              diabetes, 80M+ with pre-diabetes, and another 500M diabetics
              worldwide. It is a rapidly growing epidemic and costly not only
              financially but also in terms of human suffering. Using VR and AR,
