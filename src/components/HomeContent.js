                <p>
                  The world is no longer just 2D or 3D. Our reality is now
                  augmented, virtual, immersive and dynamic but virtual reality
                  development can be daunting. We partner with Enterprise
                  clients, brands and agencies to develop interactive virtual
                  worlds and augmented reality experiences that provide engaging
                  new ways to discover, share, collaborate and conduct commerce.
                  Our AR and VR platform allows you to reach your market using a
                  mixed reality, shared social and hyper-sensory experience that
                  was previously unavailable. It’s about depth, experiences and
                  exploration, which leads to more engagement, retention and
                  revenue. Using our advanced rendering and social networking
                  capabilities we create customized, client-specific, augmented
                  reality experiences and virtual worlds that promote and
                  protect your brand.

                  Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality in medicine is a new and
                  rapidly growing space. Virtual reality in healthcare
                  technology is allowing students of medicine, doctors and even
                  surgeons to learn, treat disease and perform complex surgical
                  procedures in ways never before possible. Virtual Reality
                  medical technology has also made it possible to develop and
                  implement new treatment protocols in the realm of behavior
                  modification. The World Health Organization estimates there
                  are 30M people in the U.S. with diabetes, 80M+ with
                  pre-diabetes, and another 500M diabetics worldwide. It is a
                  rapidly growing epidemic and costly not only financially but
                  also in terms of human suffering. Using VR and AR,
                  ImmersiveWorlds, in partnership with Boston Medical Center,
                  has developed and clinically tested new and effective
                  treatment modalities and protocols for type 2 diabetes.
